# Clinical Readmissions Analysis 🏥

This project explores hospital readmission patterns and patient outcomes using a real-world dataset of over 100,000 medical records. It combines tools like Excel, SQL, and Python for end-to-end data analysis—from cleaning to visualization and insights.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Name**: Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999–2008
- Includes: Admission types, diagnoses, medications, lab results, and readmission status

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, pivot tables, dashboard
- **SQL**: Querying, joins, aggregations, optimizations
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**: EDA, visualizations, basic modeling

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **Excel**:
   - Cleaned raw data
   - Built pivot tables for readmission rates, length of stay, etc.
2. **SQL**:
   - Created normalized tables: Patients, Admissions, Diagnoses, Medications
   - Sample queries:
     - Top 10 diagnoses by readmission
     - Avg. hospital stay per admission type
3. **Python**:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualized readmission risk by age, gender, and diagnosis
   - Correlation heatmaps and boxplots

---

## 📌 Key Findings
- **Readmission Rate**: % of patients readmitted within 30 days
- **High-Risk Diagnoses**: Top 5 linked to frequent readmission
- **Medication Impact**: Certain meds associated with higher/lower readmission
- **Demographic Trends**: Gender and age influence risk levels
